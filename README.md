### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am [Chandan Bose](www.chandanbose.com). I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the [Fluid-Structure Interactions and Experimental Aerodynamics Laboratory](), Dept.of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering, University of LiÃ¨ge, Belgium. 
I closely collaborate with the [Multi-physics and Turbulent Flow Computation research group]() here. 
I have obtained M.S. and Ph.D. from the Dept. of Applied Mechanics, IIT Madras, India. 
I worked at the [Uncertainty Laboratoty] and the [Biomimetics and Dynamics Laboratory] there. 
I am passionately interested in fluid dynamics problems of different tastes especially with a flavour of nonlinear dynamics. 
My current research focus is on understanding low speed unsteady aerodynamics/ hydrodynamics and nonlinear fluid-structure interaction behaviour of bio-inspired propulsion.

My broad areas of interest are:

- Fluid-Structure Interactions
- Biological Fluid Dynamics.
- Unsteady Aerdynamics.
- Flow Induced Energy Harvesting.
- Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos.
- High Performance Computing.
- Modal Decomposition and Reduced-Order Modelling.
- Machine Learning in Fluid Mechanics.
- Random dynamical systems.
