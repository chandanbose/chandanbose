### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Chandan is presently a senior Post-Doctoral Research Associate at the Vortex Interaction Laboratory (VOILAb) within the Institute for Energy Systems, School of Engineering, The University of Edinburgh. Previously, he was a Wallonie Bruxelles International Excellence Post-Doctoral Fellow at the Fluid-Structure Interactions and Experimental Aerodynamics Laboratory and the Multi-physics and Turbulent Flow Computation Laboratory, Dept. of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering, University of LiÃ¨ge, Belgium. He has obtained his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Dept. of Applied Mechanics, IIT Madras, India, where he worked at the Uncertainty Laboratory and the Biomimetics Laboratory. He is passionately interested in fluid dynamics problems of different tastes, especially with flavours of turbulence and nonlinear dynamics. He aims to investigate a variety of complex multiphysics problems involving coupled nonlinear interactions, among which fluid-structure interaction and turbulence are his primary research focus.

His broad areas of interest are:

- Fluid-Structure Interactions
- Unsteady Aerdynamics.
- Multi-Phase Flows.
- Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos.
- High Performance Computing.
- Machine Learning in Fluid Mechanics.
