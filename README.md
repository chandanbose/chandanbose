### Hi there üëã
Dr. Chandan Bose has recently joined as an Assistant Professor of Aerospace Engineering at the School of Metallurgy and Materials, University of Birmingham. His research group will be focussed on investigating a variety of complex multiphysics problems involving coupled nonlinear interactions, among which unsteady aerodynamics, nonlinear aeroelasticity, and bio-inspired fluid-structure interaction problems will be of primary interest. 

Before joining the University of Birmingham, Dr. Bose played a pivotal role as a senior postdoctoral research associate contributing to an ERC project ‚ÄúDandidrone‚Äù at the Vortex Interaction Laboratory, University of Edinburgh. His work revolved around deciphering the intricate fluid-structure interaction dynamics inherent in dandelion seed propulsion, culminating in its application to the development of microdrones. Additionally, he also served as an adjunct lecturer at the School of Engineering, University of Edinburgh. 

Earlier in his career, Dr. Bose embarked on a postdoctoral endeavor at the University of Liege, Belgium, during which he was bestowed with the Wallonie Bruxelles International Excellence Postdoctoral Fellowship and FNRS Postdoctoral Fellowship. This tenure was dedicated to unraveling the complexities of nonlinear aeroelasticity.

His academic journey commenced at the Department of Applied Mechanics, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, India, where he earned both his master's and Ph.D. degrees in 2019. His Ph.D. research was on the dynamical analysis of the unsteady flow phenomena around a flapping wing through high-fidelity numerical simulations and wind tunnel experiments. Noteworthy accolades, including the Institute Research Award and V. Ramamurthy Best Thesis Award (both from IIT Madras), as well as the esteemed Indian National Academy of Engineering Innovative Project Award, underscored the significance of his contributions to doctoral research. His educational voyage commenced with a graduation in Civil Engineering from Jadavpur University, India, where he clinched the university gold medalist title, standing at the pinnacle of his batch.

His broad areas of interest are:

- Fluid-Structure Interactions
- Unsteady Aerdynamics.
- Multi-Phase Flows.
- Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos.
- High Performance Computing.
- Machine Learning in Fluid Mechanics.
